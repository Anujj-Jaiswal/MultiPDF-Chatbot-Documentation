            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Scalability and Performance:</h3>
                    <p>The code may face scalability and performance issues when processing large volumes of PDF documents or handling concurrent user requests. Processing efficiency, memory usage, and response times may degrade under heavy load, impacting the overall user experience.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Maintenance and Updates:</h3>
                    <p>The codebase may require regular maintenance and updates to address issues, incorporate new features, or adapt to changes in external APIs and libraries. Without proper maintenance practices, the code may become outdated or vulnerable to security risks over time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Dependency Management:</h3>
                    <p>Managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility between different libraries and APIs used in the code can be challenging. Version conflicts, deprecated features, or changes in library behavior may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that require careful attention and testing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Language Support:</h3>
                    <p>The effectiveness of the chatbot is inherently tied to its language capabilities. The chatbot is trained on English as a primary language; it may struggle to understand queries or extract information accurately from PDF documents written in other languages. This limitation restricts its utility for users who work with documents in languages other than the one supported by the chatbot.</p>
